# More complicated effects

---

# `s(x,y)` doesn't always work

- Only works for `bs="tp"` or `bs="ts"`
- Covariates are isotropic
- What if we wanted to use lat/long?
- Or, more generally: interactions between covariates?

---

# Enter `te()`

.pull-left[
- We can built interactions using `te()`
- Construct 2D basis from 2 1D bases
- ðŸ’­ "marginal 1Ds, join them up"
]

.pull-right[
```{r tensor, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.width=8, fig.height=6, messages=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dsm_tw_xy_depth <- dsm(count ~ ti(Depth, SST) + ti(Depth) + ti(SST), 
                       ddf.obj=df_hr,
                       observation.data=obs, segment.data=segs, family=tw())
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,3), 2, 2), widths=c(1.5,1.5,1), height=c(1,1,2))
opar <- par(mar=c(4, 3, 1, 2) + 0.1)
plot(dsm_tw_xy_depth, select=3)
plot(dsm_tw_xy_depth, select=2)

vis.gam(dsm_tw_xy_depth, view=c("Depth","SST"), theta=-60, phi=30, color="bw")
par(opar)
```
]

# Using `te()`

Just like `s()`:


```{r te-ex, echo=TRUE}
dsm_te <- dsm(count ~ te(Depth, SST),
              ddf.obj=df_hr,
              observation.data=obs, segment.data=segs,
              family=tw())
```

---

# `summary`

```{r te-summ}
summary(dsm_te)
```


---


# Things to fiddle with

- Setting `k=` 2 ways:
  - `k=5`: 5 for all covariates (total $5*5=25$)
  - `k=c(3,5)`: per basis, in order (total $3*5=15$)
- Setting `bs=` 2 ways:
  - `bs="tp"`: tprs for all bases
  - `bs=c("tp", "tp")`: tprs per basis

---

# Pulling `te()` apart: `ti()`

- Can we look at the components of the `te()`
- `te(x, y) = ti(x, y) + ti(x) + ti(y)`

```{r tiex, echo=TRUE}
dsm_ti <- dsm(count ~ ti(Depth, SST) + ti(Depth) + ti(SST),
                       ddf.obj=df_hr,
                       observation.data=obs, segment.data=segs,
                       family=tw())

```

---
# `summary`

```{r ti-summ}
summary(dsm_ti)
```

---

# Space x time

- We had a 2d spatial model, add time?
  - `te(x, y, year)` ?
- `d=` groups covariates
  - `te(x, y, year, d=c(2, 1))` gives `x, y` smooth and `year` smooth tensor
- (Assuming default `k=` and `bs=` for bases above)


---

# Fiddling

- Often fewer temporal replicates
  - Fewer years than unique locations
  - `k=` smaller for temporal covariate?
- Use cubic spline basis for time?
  - simpler basis, even knot placement
- When using `ti()` arguments (`k`, `bs`) need to match up between terms
  - if `k=3` for `Depth` in one term it needs to be that in all terms

# Other effects

---

# Random effects

- "Simple" random slope/random intercept models
- `s(..., bs="re")`
- **think** about what these models mean

---

# Factor-smooth interactions

- What if we only have a few "years"?
- What if we don't think the "years" are smooth?
  - (Before/after?)
- Terms like `s(Depth, by=year)` change the smooth by year
- also `s(Depth, year, bs="fs")` (lots of ways to specify)
- see [Pedersen et al. (2019)](https://peerj.com/articles/6876/) for more on these models

# Availability

---

# Availability

- Is an animal *available* to be detected
- e.g., diving marine mammals
- Primitive way to do this in `dsm`
- `availability=` for each segment (only for `count` models)
- Active research area!

# g(0), MRDS etc

---

# Mark-recapture distance sampling

- Will be able to include these models in next `dsm` release
- Only independent observer ("`io`") and trial ("`trial`") modes supported
- [Example here](https://github.com/densitymodelling/nefsc_fin_mrds_dsm)

# Combining multiple surveys

# Combining multiple surveys

- What about combining aerial/shipboard data?
- Different detection functions
- Again, next `dsm` release allows this
- [Fitting complicated models](https://github.com/densitymodelling/nefsc_fin_mrds_dsm) example

# Finally...

# Recent developments

- New `dsm` out in the next few weeks!
- [Fitting DSMs in JAGS/Nimble](https://github.com/densitymodelling/nimble_scrubjay)
- [DenMod project](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/denmod/about/) has produced lots of methodology
- Society for Marine Mammalogy meeting December

# Deviance explained, explained

- Avoid $R^2$ (see [these notes](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/lectures/10/lecture-10.pdf) for more info)
- But what about deviance explained?
- First, what is it?

$$
D = -2(\mathcal{l}_s - \mathcal{l})
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_s$ is the *saturated* log likelihood and $\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood of our model.

- Saturated means the "best" model we can get, one parameter per data point.
- So meaning is it's relative to the best we can do *for this model*

---

# Deviance explained, explained

- `mgcv` reports "Deviance explained" as a percentage

$$
D_{\%} = 100 (\mathcal{l}_s - \mathcal{l})/ \mathcal{l}_s
$$

- Problem: for different models (with different numbers of parameters) $\mathcal{l}_s$ is different
- So are we making fair comparisons?
- AIC is simpler and easier to think about!


[More info on deviance for GAMs](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/191235)

---

# More difficulties with explanatory power

- Low (<60%) deviance is common. But why?
- Sampling a temporally variable system
- Revisiting the same place multiple times, we might get zero counts twice and then one large count.
- What should the model make of this?
- Without explicit temporal model, it tries to average
- So prediction will be a "medium" count, bad prediction for the zeros and the large counts
- No one is happy!
- See observed vs. expected diagnostics etc
